# AuthWallet 2.5

![top](./app/public/top.png)

Simplifying Wallet Management with OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect, JWT, and RSA Verification and Account Abstraction

## Description

AuthWallet 2.5 revolutionizes the way users interact with Ethereum wallets by integrating OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect, JWT, and RSA verification. This user-friendly solution eliminates the need for complex private key management, making secure wallet interactions accessible to all users. With AuthWallet, users can send ETH by email, manage attestations, and execute cross-chain transactions with ease.

## How It Works

### Google JWKS Data Retrieval:

The application leverages Chainlink Functions and Chainlink Automation to securely fetch Googleâ€™s JSON Web Key Set (JWKS). These keys are used to verify JWTs signed by Google. The JWKS data is regularly updated to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the keys used in RSA signature verification for OAuth2.0 tokens.

### OAuth2.0 & OpenID Connect for User Sign-In:

Users authenticate via OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect flows. Upon successful authentication, the user receives an ID Token containing key information, including an account abstraction user operation hash. This hash represents a cryptographic fingerprint of the user's intended transaction on the blockchain.

### Smart Contract JWT Verification:

The ID Token generated during sign-in contains a JWT. A dedicated smart contract verifies the JWT using RSA signature verification against the modulus fetched from the JWKS oracle. This ensures that the JWT is authentic and has been signed by Google. The contract interacts with the Chainlink-powered JWKS oracle to retrieve and validate the appropriate RSA keys used for signature verification.

### EIP-1193 Compatibility:

The AuthWallet 2.5 is fully compatible with EIP-1193: Ethereum Provider JavaScript API. It also supports modern Ethereum libraries like viem and wagmi, making it easy to integrate with decentralized applications (dApps). In this demo, we utilize RainbowKit to simplify the connection of AuthWallet 2.5 to the Ethereum network.

### Benefit

With AuthWallet 2.5, users do not need to have an existing wallet address to get started. This eliminates the barrier of requiring a wallet setup before onboarding, making it easier for new users to engage with the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Inspiration

This implementation is heavily inspired by the referenced article and has been adapted to align with ERC4337 account abstraction principles.

## Bounties

### Chainlink Functions and Automation:

These are used to fetch Google OAuth RSA Public Key Information. Since the keys are rotated frequently, automation is essential to ensure up-to-date information. Due to data limits, atomic chain requests are employed to securely retrieve the key info directly into the smart contract.

### SignProtocol Integration:

We have created a sample schema using SignProtocol that demonstrates how to create a schema based on an email address. This eliminates the need for complex user onboarding processes, enabling attestations to be sent via email addresses. This integration opens up a wide range of business use cases where email-based attestations can be leveraged.

### LayerZero Integration:

We have deployed an omnichain execution infrastructure using LayerZero. This allows users to execute transactions across any chain seamlessly, empowering them to manage assets and handle gas fees with ease. For onboarding, assets or attestations can be sent to any chain, and users can access them through omnichain account management. This integration simplifies multi-chain interactions and asset management.
