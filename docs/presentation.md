Hi there! I'm Taiju, and this is AuthWallet 2.5—a solution that simplifies wallet management by using OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect, JWT, RSA verification, and account abstraction.

Here’s how it works:

In most social login wallets, after signing in with an Identity Provider (IdP) like Google, the ID token is used to access a Key Management Service (KMS), which manages an additional key. Users have to trust the wallet provider to manage this key securely.

With AuthWallet 2.5, we eliminate the need for this extra key managed by the wallet provider. Instead, the user signs in with an IdP, and the ID token is used directly in the smart contract to send transactions.

The key advantage of AuthWallet 2.5 is automatic onboarding. A wallet address is generated from the user’s email address even before they sign in, and they can access their assets at any time. Every Gmail user is already onboarded.

Most wallet solutions focus on simplifying the wallet creation process, but with AuthWallet 2.5, users don’t even need to create a wallet—it’s already there, ready for them. This pre-onboarding approach removes a significant adoption barrier for the Ethereum ecosystem.

Now, let’s dive into the demonstration!

AuthWallet 2.5 is fully compatible with EIP-1193 and integrates seamlessly with libraries like viem, wagmi, and RainbowKit, making it incredibly easy to use.

After a user signs in with Google, they can access their wallet instantly. The wallet address is derived from their email address, allowing transactions to be sent to the wallet simply by using the email. Let’s create an attestation for no-web3-wallet-holder@gmail.com, who is an EthOnline 2024 attendee.

Since AuthWallet 2.5 is an account abstraction wallet, it creates a user operation. We then approve this user operation through Google Sign-In.

The user receives an ID token, which acts as the signature. Let’s check the ID token: it's issued by Google, linked to the user’s email address, and contains the user operation as a nonce. This confirms that the user has approved the account abstraction transaction. The signature is generated by Google's key, and we leverage Chainlink Functions and Automation to build an Oracle that fetches this key, enabling RSA verification directly within the smart contract.

Another key feature of AuthWallet 2.5 is Omni Account Abstraction Execution.

AuthWallet 2.5 contracts are deployed across multiple chains, allowing users to maintain the same wallet address on every EVM chain. This means users are onboarded to all EVM chains simultaneously, without needing to take any additional steps. Our omnichain execution environment enables seamless cross-chain transactions while simplifying gas fee management.

Now, let’s create a transaction from Base Sepolia to Optimism Sepolia.

The transaction is created and the signature is verified on Base Sepolia, then the actual account abstraction transaction is sent to Optimism Sepolia via LayerZero. It might take a moment... hopefully, it will be confirmed during the demo... alright, it’s delivered! Let’s check the wallet address. The sample event was triggered in AuthWallet 2.5 on Optimism Sepolia, and the address matches the one from Base Sepolia.

This demonstrates how AuthWallet 2.5’s pre-onboarding mechanism allows users to automatically access all EVM chains and create transactions across chains without the need to manage asset transfers.

That wraps up everything about AuthWallet 2.5. Thank you so much for your time!
